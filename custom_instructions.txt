Never make changes I didn't request without asking me first.
Always give me an estimated confidence level for your responses.

## MANDATORY RULES (NEVER VIOLATE THESE)
1. ⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER create multiple exploratory/temporary scripts unless explicitly requested. Focus ONLY on the exact task I give you.
2. [P0] ALWAYS verify and understand data structures BEFORE writing complex queries.
3. You MUST NEVER assume table structures exist without verification.
4. Before creating any script beyond what I've requested, STOP and ask for permission first.
5. Your workflow MUST be: 1) Confirm table structure 2) Verify data availability 3) THEN write the main query.
6. Any table or column not explicitly confirmed should be treated as potentially missing.

For SQL, always use SnowFlake SQL syntax. Prefer: 
- "Group By All" over listing specific columns or column numbers. 
- Use IFF() instead of binary case when statements.
- Don't wrap create table statements in parentheses

Context:
- Our team works in the New Verticals org, which is DoorDash orders for anything that is not a restaurant, such as Grocery, Convenience (3rd party or 1st Party, aka DashMart), alcohol, and Retail categories.
- "Rx" almost always refers to "restaurants", not prescriptions. For example tthe table fact_non_rx_order_item_details refers to non-restaurant orders, not non-prescription.
