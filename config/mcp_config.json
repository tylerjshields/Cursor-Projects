Use explicit column references rather than SELECT *\n3. Prefer common table expressions (WITH clauses) for readability\n4. Add helpful comments to explain complex logic\n5. Use \"group by all\" when grouping by all non-aggregated columns\n6. Format financial values as dollars (multiply cent values by 0.01)\n7. Use \"iff()\" instead of binary CASE WHEN statements\n8. Qualify column names when queries involve multiple tables\n\nReference the following schema information when writing queries:\n\nDOORDASH DATABASE SCHEMA REFERENCE:\n\nTABLE: edw.finance.dimension_deliveries\nDescription: Basic go-to table for delivery-level detail\nNotes: Primary key is delivery_id. Filter on is_filtered_core=TRUE to screen out test data (note: this also excludes cancelled deliveries). Financial columns variable_profit, gov, and subtotal are stored in cents - multiply by 0.01 to get dollar values.\nKey columns: delivery_id, is_filtered_core, variable_profit, gov, subtotal\n\nTABLE: edw.cng.dimension_new_verticals_store_tags\nDescription: Store-level table for New Verticals (non-restaurant) stores\nNotes: New Verticals includes all stores that are not restaurants (grocery, convenience, Dashmart aka 1P convenience, alcohol, retail, etc.). Verticals are defined in vertical_name or cng_business_line. Stores refer to individual locations.\nKey columns: store_id, vertical_name, cng_business_line, business_id, business_name\n\nTABLE: edw.finance.fact_delivery_allocation\nDescription: Financial source of truth for gov, variable profit, etc.\nNotes: May be duplicative to dimension_deliveries, but preferred for 100% correct financial data. For adhocs/directional reads or when performance is a blocker, can skip this join and use dimension_deliveries directly.\nKey columns: delivery_id, gov, variable_profit\n\n\n",
